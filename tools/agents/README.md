# D8 Agents (local tools)

These scripts are local equivalents / helpers for the workflow agents.

- D8_AGENT_CANARY.ps1      -> probe endpoints with cache-busters
- D8_AGENT_EVIDENCE.ps1    -> collect local evidence bundle
- D8_AGENT_TRIAGE.ps1      -> list gh workflows + recent runs

Primary automation is in .github/workflows/*.yml
